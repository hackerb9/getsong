# getsong
Given a song name, artist, lyrics or whatever, search for and download a song using yt-dlp.

* Handles multiple arguments (including embedded spaces) correctly. 
* Uses youtube.com URL, instead of ytsearch:
* Allows `-c` to restrict search to videos with closed captions (manually generated lyrics/subtitles).
*  Can read search terms from a file, downloading one song per line.
* If `xsel` is installed, will search for whatever words are currently highlighted by the mouse cursor and download that song.
* Can download videos instead by changing the script's name: `ln -s getsong getvideo`

## Installation

It's just a bash script. Download it, make it executable, and put it in your PATH. 

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackerb9/getsong/main/getsong
chmod +x getsong
sudo mv getsong /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

Usage: **getsong** [ _-c_ ] [ _keywords_ ... ]

   _-c_: filter to only results with closed captions (subtitles)
   
   _keywords_: a song title, lyrics, artist name, or anything, really.

If no keywords are specified, then the X selection (the
last text highlighted by the mouse) will be used.

If you redirect a file to stdin, then getsong will perform a search for
every song listed in the file, one per line. 

## Examples

Search YouTube and download audio that matches two phrases

    getsong "Mr. Orange" "Dengue Fever"

Filter search to only results with "closed captions" (lyrics or other subtitles that have been manually generated by the uploader)

    getsong -c "A week ago last Thursday"
